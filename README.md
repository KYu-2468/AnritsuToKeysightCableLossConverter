# AnritsuToKeysightCableLossConverter
An app that converts Anritsu cable loss files to Keysight supported cable loss structure.

The purpose of this app is to automate the boring manual tasks so engineers can focus on the harder problems.
Please download the .py files and execute them if you're familiar with python, or please download the compiled version .exe and execute them.
Once executed, please select the folder of all the files that you've like to convert.

The code doesn't follow best practices what so ever as it was meant to solve the problems within a limited timeframe.
